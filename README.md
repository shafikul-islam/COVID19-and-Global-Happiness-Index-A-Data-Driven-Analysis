# COVID19 and Global Happiness Index: A Data-Driven Analysis


## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed a global health crisis but also impacted various socio-economic factors worldwide. This project delves into understanding the relationship between the spread of COVID-19 in different countries and the happiness index of their residents. By merging COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University with the World Happiness Report, this project aimed to uncover insights that link health crises with societal well-being.

## Objectives

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Import and preprocess COVID-19 datasets, aggregate data by country, and prepare for analysis.
2. **Visualization**: Visualize COVID-19 data related to countries like China, Italy, and Spain to gain insights into the spread of the virus.
3. **Measuring Impact**: Calculate a suitable metric to describe the severity of the virus's spread in each country.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore correlations between COVID-19 statistics and various life factors like GDP, freedom, and healthy life expectancy.
